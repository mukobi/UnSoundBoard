# UnSoundBoard
A clean soundboard application built in Unreal Engine 4.

## Description

I wanted to use a soundboard application to play sounds through a virtual microphone while playing D&D online with friends, but I couldn't find one that I liked. Most of the soundboards looked ugly, limited the number of sounds you could use or see, and critically, would not have any randomization of the sounds played.

So I made this project to address those issues. UnSoundBoard looks clean, it resizes based on the window size, and it allows you to randomly play a sound from many in the same folder when playing the soundboard button for that folder.

## Usage

Details will come soon. If they aren't here and you want this, just reach out to me and I'll update it.
